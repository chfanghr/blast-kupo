Package blaster provides the back-end for blast - a tool for load testing and sending api requests in bulk.

	Blast
	=====

	* Blast makes API requests at a fixed rate.
	* The number of concurrent workers is configurable.
	* The rate may be changed interactively during execution.
	* Blast is protocol agnostic, and adding a new worker type is trivial.
	* For load testing: random data can be added to API requests.
	* For batch jobs: CSV data can be loaded from local file or GCS bucket, and successful items from previous runs are skipped.

	Installation
	============
	## Mac
	```
	brew tap dave/blast
	brew install blast
	```

	## Linux
	See the [releases page](https://github.com/dave/blast/releases)

	## From source
	```
	go get -u github.com/dave/blast
	```

	Examples
	========
	Using the dummy worker to send at 20,000 requests per second (the dummy worker returns after a random wait, and occasionally returns errors):
	```
	blast --rate=20000 --workers=1000 --worker-type="dummy" --worker-template='{"min":25,"max":50}'
	```

	Using the http worker to request Google's homepage at one request per second (warning: this is making real http requests - don't turn the rate up!):
	```
	blast --rate=1 --worker-type="http" --payload-template='{"method":"GET","url":"http://www.google.com/"}'
	```

	Status
	======

	Blast prints a summary every ten seconds. While blast is running, you can hit enter for an updated
	summary, or enter a number to change the sending rate. Each time you change the rate a new column
	of metrics is created. If the worker returns a field named `status` in it's response, the values
	are summarised as rows.

	Here's an example of the output:

	```
	Metrics

	Config
	======
	Blast is configured by config file, command line flags or environment variables. The `--config` flag specifies the config file to load, and can be `json`, `yaml`, `toml` or anything else that [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) can read. If the config flag is omitted, blast searches for `blast-config.xxx` in the current directory, `$HOME/.config/blast/` and `/etc/blast/`.

	Environment variables and command line flags override config file options. Environment variables are upper case and prefixed with "BLAST" e.g. `BLAST_PAYLOAD_TEMPLATE`.

	Templates
	=========
	The `payload-template` and `worker-template` options accept values that are rendered using the Go text/template system. Variables of the form `{{ .name }}` or `{{ "name" }}` are replaced with data.

	Additionally, several simple functions are available to inject random data which is useful in load testing scenarios:

	* `{{ rand_int -5 5 }}` - a random integer between -5 and 5.
	* `{{ rand_float -5 5 }}` - a random float between -5 and 5.
	* `{{ rand_string 10 }}` - a random string, length 10.
